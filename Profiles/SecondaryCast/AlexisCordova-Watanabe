            She was met with a foxy grin from her now apron wearing, spatula wielding wife. “Maybe not like this, I feel hungry, hungry like the fox.” She stepped out from behind the island to reveal a tan apron, “Hungry like the wolf” was emblazoned on it, with a full moon instead of an o.

            The former director of the Department of Nonhuman Services, Alexis currently enjoys a quiet life with her beloved foxy wife, Hikari Watanabe. The two live in Mukilteo, Washington. Alexis enjoys long walks on the beach and contributing to open source software; she also serves on the board of several charities. 
        </p>


        <p hidden class="redacted classifiedalexistext">
            Alexis' entire life has been defined by what happened to her at the age of six, <span>when her father sold her out to the United States Government</span> as part of a secret military operation called the Future Patriot Program. Implanted with the best of human cybernetics available at the time and <span> experimental ill-gotten alien technology</span>, Alexis became Future Eagle 11,<span> a replacement for the 2nd in the program</span> and charged with acting as the commander of <span>any United States military units operating </span> in Washington-Oregon-California after a hypothetical thermonuclear <span>World War III that wiped out most of US Central Command </span>. 
        </p>

        <p hidden class="redacted classifiedalexistext">
            When the inevitable thermonuclear fire didn't come to pass, <span>she was shelved with the rest of the cold war relics  in case she would ever need to be used </span> again
           Softly ushered into the Department of Nonhuman Services, generally considered one of the safest departments in the entire government. She quickly proved to be a natural leader,<span> no doubt to her ungodly amount of experience in such </span>, and rose up the ranks to become the Director; a position she occupied until being kicked out the door by the Clinton, Trump, Sanders, or <span>Insane Clown Posse</span> administrations.
