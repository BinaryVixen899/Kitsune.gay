            She glanced around in the dark. The tennis shoes were still there. Wait, at the end of the; oh, that was a baseball bat, not a tail. She still couldn’t see anything with the glare from the light. Ugh. Why was she doing it this way to begin with? They could both see in the dark. Perhaps it was simply her humanity, somewhere at the back of her mind one of those basic truisms lurked; “Do not, under any circumstances, be alone in a room with a wolf. And if you are alone in a room with a wolf, do not, under any circumstances, have that room be a dark one.”

            Anastasia Romanov was supposed to die in a basement in Yekaterinburg, but that didn't happen. So she was supposed to die after her and two of her sisters were discovered alive in the truck that carried the corpses of their family; but yet again, she failed to die. One can presume that the third place she was supposed to die was lying in the snow, freezing to death and bleeding out. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps the Russian winter was too cold even for death that day, or perhaps when she fell out of the back of the Fiat, she fell out of Death's grasp as well. A moment missed, forevermore. 
        </p>
        <p>
            What is known about her life afterwards is very sparse. Perhaps she was happy for a time. She certainly had family in Paris, and with no need to eat, drink, or even breathe could she not have fled there? There are scattered reports of her in Leningrad, hazy Soviet documents that appear to suggest the regime entertained her possible existence for a time. But then again; it entertained the existence of countless imposters as well. But after a while, she yields the spotlight to Anna Anderson. If deliberate, a perfect feint. 
        </p>
        <p>
         
        <p>
            What does she do during all those unaccounted years? Does she live out her previous life? Does she quietly settle down? Or is she trapped in the trauma of so long ago. <br> 
            After all, when one has all of eternity; what need is there to see a therapist anytime soon? It's not like time is running out. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Somehow, she winds up on the west coast of America, the new roommate of one Anastasia O' Malley
